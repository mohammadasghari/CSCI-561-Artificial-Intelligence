# CSCI-561-Artificial-Intelligence 

This repo includes my solutions to the assigments of CSCI-561 Artificial Intelligence course in University of Southern California.

## Code structure
- `./homework1/`: contains code for the implementation of **Alpha-Beta pruning** algorithm with positional weight evaluation functions for solving _Reversi game_.
- `./homework2/`: contains code for the implementation of **PL-Resolution** algorithm for propositional logic.
- `./homework3/`: contains code for the implementation of performing inference in Decision Networks/Bayesian networks.
